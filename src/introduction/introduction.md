# Introduction

This book is meant to serve as a rapid introduction to the rust programming language.
It is geared towards developers that are already fairly experienced with programming in other languages.
Specifically, experience in C/C++ or something similar is recommended.

We will not waste time with concepts such as pointers, loops, structs, etc.
Instead, we will dive right into rust syntax/idioms and talk about how it is different from other languages.

This book will contain many examples and is written based on the concept of "show, don't tell".
There are also quiz questions throughout to encourage the reader to think deeper or experiment with code.

There will likely be some mistakes and typos.
Please reach out if any are spotted.
