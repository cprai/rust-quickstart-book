# Ecosystem

Third partly libraries in rust are referred to as crates.
When we create our own project, it is also referred to as a crate.
Our crate can have dependencies on other crates.
We can find crates made by other users at [https://crates.io/](https://crates.io/).

When using `cargo` to manage our project, it will automatically download and compile any crate dependencies.

The rust ecosystem favours crates that are MIT/APACHE dual licensed.

One of the strong points of rust is the expansive ecosystem of high quality crates made by other users.

### Mascot

This is Ferris, the unofficial rust mascot.

Rust fanatics might sometimes call themselves "Rustaceans".
If this word comes up, it is a good sign to walk away rapidly.
